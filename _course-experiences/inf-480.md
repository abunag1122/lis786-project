## Capstone Project
# Taken: Spring Semester 2024 - 2025
# Course Description

The Capstone Experience (CE) showcases the student’s intellectual advances and technical skills developed in the program by providing a creative venue for expressing their interests and growth. Additionally, the CE prepares students for the job market by providing structured time for job prospecting, preparing materials (e.g., résumés, cover letters, design portfolios, etc.), and getting feedback from faculty and the career services coordinator on job applications and mock interview sessions. Students will create a digital portfolio and complete one of three experiences: an internship, a project, or a thesis.
