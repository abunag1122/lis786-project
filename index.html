<h2> About Me </h2>

<p><img src="/lis786-project/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Arwin Bunag"></p>

    
<p> My name is Arwin Bunag, I'm a current student at Dominican University who's pursuing a bachelor's in Informatics!</p>

<p>My journey through Informatics has been unexpected. That is to say, that phrasing is something that I could also apply to my entire undergraduate experience at Dominican University. But I digress.</p>

<p>To start, when I entered college four years ago I was undecided, both figuratively and literally — I didn’t have a major or any idea what to pursue. The Informatics discipline was brought to my attention when an upperclassman recommended I take the INF 110 class to fulfill a multicultural requirement. That was back in the Spring Semester of my Freshman year. Evidently, I found the course compelling enough to take the 120 course, and then declare Informatics as my major later in my Sophomore year.</p>

<p>But with that said, what have I gained throughout my studies within the discipline? A lot—ish. I would describe the Informatics discipline as sort of a "Tech Swiss-Army Knife," in the sense that it touches on a lot of different subjects, but is not fully specialized for one specific thing. In that regard, there are positives. For one, knowledge and a decent understanding of different subjects and what they are. However, there are some negatives as well. The primary one being a lack of in-depth skills. By that I mean, while I may know the basics of, say, Java as a programming language, I’m definitely not as well-versed in it as someone whose studies are more oriented toward that field.</p>

<p>At this current point in time, I do not have any professional positions lined up (pray that will change, please!), but that’s not to say I feel unqualified for the upcoming job search. Since studying Informatics, I feel as though my mind has become more data-oriented. As in, the way I approach things has become more focused on the information I’ve received. As of writing this, my job hunt is still ongoing, but I do at least have a plan for the future. In the long term, I plan on honing further the particular skills I’ve gained through the experiences studying Informatics. At which point, I will leverage said skills to land some sort of career within the industry and advance further in whatever organization I find myself in.</p>

<p>With all that out of the way, I’d like to thank all those who have built me up and supported me throughout my college years, and I hope to make you all proud!</p>
